instead of py or python in cade, use the path: /usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-3.5.0/bin/python3
or
/usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-2.7.3/bin/python


then to install nltk as:
usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-3.5.0/bin/python3 -m nltk.downloader -d /home/$USER/nltk_data all


#Varsha - input_file path: C:\Users\Varsha\PycharmProjects\NLP\nlp_daringduck\developset


NEED NLTK in cade machine..nltk is available in the python 3 version and so, need to use the above path to execute the file
If it doesn't run and gives a "pickle error", then we need some packages in nltk:
1. type in the path for the specific python3
2. type import nltk
3. type nltk.download()
4. if it asks for a package , type all (this will take a few mins)
5. then execute the file.
